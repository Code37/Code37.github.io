This paper also takes the perspect of network of global industrial support, simultaneously analyzing the evolution of key industries in China's service trade with domestic ratio of value-added during the year 2004~2013 and then locates the direction for position development of heterogeneous sectors. The results show that the development of China's service trade falls into the "Low Ratio of Value-Added Trap", and the structure of our service trade is not strong enough to defend the crisis. However, the development of our service trade still displays the extensive form, and tends to develop trade relationship with the emerging markets at this stage. During the period of 13th Five-Year, how to materialize the adjustment of the structure to prompt the quality of service trade and improve the crisis-defending competence becomes an imperative task ahead.
